# Final-IT-Project: Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Reporting Platform

## Project Overview

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is a critical issue in South Africa, affecting people across all ages and backgrounds. It often goes unreported due to fear, stigma, lack of trust in authorities, and limited access to support. This project proposes a **mobile-first, secure, and anonymous digital platform** that empowers survivors and bystanders to report GBV incidents safely and discreetly.

The platform aims to increase reporting by offering:

* End-to-end encrypted, anonymous reporting.
* Real-time incident location tagging via GPS.
* Immediate access to support resources like legal aid, shelters, and helplines.
* Optional case tracking and follow-up communication.
* Data insights for NGOs, law enforcement, and policymakers.

## Features

* **Anonymous and secure reporting**
* **GPS-based incident location tagging**
* **Resource directory for immediate help**
* **Optional case tracking system**
* **Data analytics for trend monitoring**
* **Mobile-first user interface for accessibility**

## Motivation

South Africa faces one of the highest rates of GBV globally. Survivors often face barriers to reporting, including fear of retaliation and social stigma. Existing reporting methods are often inaccessible or unsafe. This platform addresses these challenges by providing a discreet, accessible, and trustworthy alternative to empower survivors and improve response efforts.
